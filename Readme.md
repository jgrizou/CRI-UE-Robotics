# Introduction to robotics @ CRI Paris (October 2019)


**Course description:** Introductory course to robotics. Robotics is about building machines that can act in the real world and often substitute human action. Together, students and teachers will decipher how robots work and why engineers built them the way they are. The course will be based on hands-on manipulation of robots to learn basic concepts related to sensing, acting, and planning.


**Course objectives:** By manipulating robots, students will discover what robots are made of and understand how each component works. In small teams, students will program robots to complete simple tasks such as line following, obstacle avoidance, and automated drawing; which will help them understand some of the basic concepts of robotics: feedback loops, odometry, trajectory planning, direct and inverse model. The final project will be a robotic sumo competition.
