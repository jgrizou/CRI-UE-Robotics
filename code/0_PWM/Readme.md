## Hand coding motion - PWM

- Explain how motors works
- Explain motor control (use a motor found in class)
- Explain H-bridge
- Explain PWM

- Pin connection: https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/3.3
- Delay micro seconds: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/delaymicroseconds/

Explain PWM are hardware dedicated to do that because that would take your full program. Try printing something on the screen for example: lcd.print(random(100)).

### PWM work with LED too

Same as motors
