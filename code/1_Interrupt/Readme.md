## Hand coding encoders

Explain how hall effect sensors work
Explain principle of encoders

Use piece of paper showing only two windows of what happened

Explain implementation with XOR
Explain interrupts
Play with interrupts -> increment counter on each interrupt
Prediction: How much ticks for 1 turn of the wheel -> 12*75

^ (bitwise xor)

Problem of slipping, drift, etc -> need calibration




In competition, people use a free wheel system to solve that problem, more accurate (point contact, passive, etc)
